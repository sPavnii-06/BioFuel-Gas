BioFuel-Gas
AN IOT SOLUTION FOR DETECTING HARMFUL BIOFUEL GASES INSIDE GAS CHAMBERS

🔬 Real-time monitoring of methane & toxic gases in a biofuel chamber

📘 Project Description

This project ensures safety in biofuel generation by continuously monitoring hazardous gases like Methane (CH₄), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Air Quality (CO₂ / VOCs) using MQ-4, MQ-7, and MQ-135 gas sensors. The system detects harmful concentrations in real-time and alerts the user using an LCD display and buzzer.

The goal is to make agriculture-based biofuel units safer by preventing gas leakage hazards.

🚨 Problem Statement

Biofuel production from agricultural waste produces toxic and explosive gases. Manual monitoring is unsafe and inefficient. A low-cost IoT-based smart alert system is required for rural and industrial biofuel chambers.

🎯 Objectives

Prevent accidents caused by excess methane buildup
Protect workers with alert notifications
Ensure efficient hydrogen/biofuel generation
Provide low-cost safety solution for farmers
🛠 Hardware Components

Component	Purpose
Arduino Uno	Main controller
MQ-135 Sensor	Air Quality / VOC / CO₂
MQ-7 Sensor	Carbon Monoxide
MQ-4 Sensor	Methane Detection
16x2 LCD	Live display output
Buzzer	Alert system
Potentiometer, Wires, Breadboard	Circuit connection
⚙ Working Principle

1️⃣ Sensors detect gas concentration 2️⃣ Arduino converts sensor values → ppm 3️⃣ If gas > safety threshold → Alert ⚠ 4️⃣ LCD displays real-time data 5️⃣ Buzzer activates for danger condition
